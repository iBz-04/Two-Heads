## Features 

- **Multi-Model Collaboration** - GPT-4 (analyst), GPT-3.5 (creative), GPT-4o (synthesizer)
- **Confidence Scoring** - Each response includes self-assessed confidence percentage
- **Structured Rounds** - 2 debate rounds with progressive refinement
- **Follow-up Support** - Continuous dialogue for extended problem solving
- **Transparent Process** - Full conversation history tracking

## Working principles 

- A[User Input] --> B(Alpha Analysis)
- B --> C(Beta Critique)
- C --> D{2 Rounds}
- D --> E[Gamma Synthesis]
- E --> F[Final Answer]

## Architecture 

The system workflow is designed as follows:

1. **User Input**: The process begins with the userâ€™s query.
2. **Alpha Analysis**: Initial responses are generated by designated AI models.
3. **Beta Critique**: A critique phase identifies possible improvements.
4. **Debate Rounds**: Two structured rounds refine the analysis.
5. **Gamma Synthesis**: A synthesis model compiles the final answer.
6. **Final Answer**: The refined solution is delivered to the user.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Add your open ai api key
4. Run the application. `python main.py`

## Usage

Interact with the system via a command line interface. Simply provide your query and follow the on-screen instructions for a guided problem-solving experience.
