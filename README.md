## Overview

The AI Collaborative Problem Solver leverages the strengths of multiple AI models to produce comprehensive and refined solutions. It orchestrates a series of debates and synthesis rounds that ensure well-rounded problem solving.

## Architecture üèóÔ∏è

The system workflow is designed as follows:

1. **User Input**: The process begins with the user‚Äôs query.
2. **Alpha Analysis**: Initial responses are generated by designated AI models.
3. **Beta Critique**: A critique phase identifies possible improvements.
4. **Debate Rounds**: Two structured rounds refine the analysis.
5. **Gamma Synthesis**: A synthesis model compiles the final answer.
6. **Final Answer**: The refined solution is delivered to the user.
